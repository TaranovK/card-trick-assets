# Generalization of Gergonne's Magic Trick
Unlike classical 27 card trick based on the ternary number system, the current implementation of the trick supports all number systems and the number times cards are dealt. 

After learning the trick with 27 cards, people usually have false felling that 27 is a special magic number which has some properties to perform the trick. In this code example, I'd like to show that the trick can be generalized to an arbitrary number of piles and deals.
